##  Here's a breakdown of its key components and functionalities:
1. **User Interface (UI):** The home page is the first screen that users see when they visit our website. It includes an introduction to PMT.
2. **Profile Listing:** Displays a list of existing profiles with essential details (such as name, phone, speed, etc.), allowing users to quickly scan through available profiles.
3. **Create Profile:** Allows users to input information to create a new profile. It typically includes a form with fields for various profile attributes, such as name, phone, etc. Upon submission, the new profile is added to the list.
4. **Update Profile:** Provides the ability to edit and update existing profiles. Clicking on an "Update" button or similar functionality opens a form pre-filled with the profile's existing details, allowing modifications to be made and saved.
5. **Delete Profile:** Allows users to remove profiles from the system. Typically, this involves a confirmation step to prevent accidental deletions.
6. **API Integration:** Communicates with a backend server or API to perform CRUD operations on a database or storage system. This could involve using libraries like Axios or fetch to send HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to the server.
7. **Validation and Error Handling:** Implements validation checks on input fields to ensure data integrity and handles errors gracefully, providing feedback to users in case of invalid inputs or failed operations.
8. **Responsive Design:** Ensures the application is responsive and works well across various devices and screen sizes.
9. **State Management:** Using the redux toolkit to manage the application's state, ensuring reactivity and synchronization of data across different components.
